# Self Critique 
My role in the group was to design the finance page skeleton and 
getting feedback for our website. It was very enjoyable asking fellow
students not in 362 about our site and getting their feedback on how
we could improve certain features on our site. I've learned that this 
is one of my strengths and what I enjoy doing overall and like it a bit 
more than the programming aspects of the class. 

# Group Member Critiques
- Alexander Keating: He's a great team member to work with and very proactive 
  and outspoken in the group. His knowledge and implementation of HTML and Javascript
  are great and having him part of the group was a big help and relief. 
- Tony Nguyen: Was the team leader of the group and very on top of handing all 
  the pull requests and managing them. He was very easy to get a hold of and 
  very reliable as he knew a lot like how to write good CSS and worked along 
  side Lucy on the pages. 
- Lucero Garcia: She knew a LOT about good web page design and very excited when I 
  first saw the login page. She is proactive and loves coding and was always willing 
  to do extra to get the best design possible. 
- Jacob Krupa: He is very reliable and is very attentive to little details in the files
  both he and the team was putting in requests for. He enjoys working with CSS and Javascript
  and it really shows through his commits and the amount of time he put in toward this project.
  
  Overall I really enjoyed working with this group! They are very fun people to work with and they 
  showed that I have plenty more to learn and improve on after seeing how comfortable 
  they were when making the HTML, editing the CSS, and creating the JavaScript for the redesign. 
  One thing I do wish we could've managed better was our time. It was kinda unstructured at first and 
  we didn't really decide dates of when we should get together and sort out the code. We figured it out 
  though as due dates were approaching and managed to create a very nice looking portal redesign. :^)
